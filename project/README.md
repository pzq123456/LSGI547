## Project Topic
- Identify a topic relevant to GIS applications and apply GIS methods to address the problems in the fields related to the lecture content and technologies of GIS.
- A good project topic and a feasible GIS solution are the keys.

## Group Building
- 4-5 members per group, all members should contribute significantly to the group project and work as a team and take on different roles such as:
  - A project manager who oversees the project's progress and communicates with the teachers.
  - A technical lead who is familiar with programming/spatial data processing and leads the technical aspects.
  - A presenter who presents your project in the interim project presentation.
- All members are required to present the project work in the final project presentation, and the contributions of all the members should be clearly stated in the final project presentation and the final written report.

## Assessment
- The group project accounts for 50% of the overall grade.
- The assessment is based on the group as an integral part. The contributions of all the members should be clearly stated in the final project presentation and the final written report, which will also be considered for the final assessment of each group member.
- There are three components for the assessment of the group project work:
  - Interim project presentation (5%): a preliminary presentation for the initial plan; only one presenter is needed as the representative for the group.
  - Final project presentation (10%): a complete summary and presentation of the project. All members should participate in the presentation.
  - Project report (35%): a complete written summary of the project. All members should contribute to the final report.

## Interim Project Presentation (Mar. 6)
- Each group will have 8 min allocated, including 5 min for presentation and the remaining 3 min for feedback.
- Each group will need a presenter as the representative to present your initial project plan.
