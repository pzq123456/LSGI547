    ABSTRACT = {In complex terrain, ground-based lidar wind speed measurements sometimes show noticeable differences compared to measurements made with in-situ sensors mounted on meteorological masts. These differences are mostly caused by the inhomogeneities of the flow field and the applied reconstruction methods. This study investigates three different methods to optimize the reconstruction algorithm in order to improve the agreement between lidar measurements and data from sensors on meteorological masts. The methods include a typical velocity azimuth display (VAD) method, a leave-one-out cross-validation method, and a linear model which takes into account the gradients of the wind velocity components. In addition, further aspects such as the influence of the half opening angle of the scanning cone and the scan duration are considered. The measurements were carried out with two different lidar systems, that measured simultaneously. The reference was a 100 m high meteorological mast. The measurements took place in complex terrain characterized by a 150 m high escarpment. The results from the individual methods are quantitatively compared with the measurements of the cup anemometer mounted on the meteorological mast by means of the three parameters of a linear regression (slope, offset, R 2 ) and the width of the 5th–95th quantile. The results show that expanding the half angle of the scanning cone from 20 ∘ to 55 ∘ reduces the offset by a factor of 14.9, but reducing the scan duration does not have an observable benefit. The linear method has the lowest uncertainty and the best agreement with the reference data (i.e., lowest offset and scatter) of all of the methods that were investigated.},

    abstract = {An evaluation of the use of airborne lidar for multi-temporal forest height growth assessment in a temperate mature red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.) plantation over a five-year period is presented. The objective was to evaluate the level of uncertainty in lidar-based growth estimates through time so that the optimal repeat interval necessary for statistically meaningful growth measurements could be evaluated. Four airborne lidar datasets displaying similar survey configuration parameters were collected between 2000 and 2005. Coincident with the 2002 and 2005 acquisitions, field mensuration for 126 trees within 19 plots was carried out. Field measurements of stem height were compared to both coincident plot-level laser pulse return (LPR) height percentile metrics and stand level raster canopy height models (CHM). The average plot-level field heights were found to be 23.8 m (standard deviation (σ)=0.4 m) for 2002 and 25.0 m (σ=0.6 m) for 2005, with an approximate annual growth rate of 0.4 m/yr (σ=0.5 m). The standard deviation uncertainty for field height growth estimates over the three year period was 41% at the plot-level (n=19) and 92% at the individual tree level (n=126). Of the lidar height percentile metrics tested, the 90th (L90), 95th (L95) and maximum (Lmax) LPR distribution heights demonstrated the highest overall correlations with field-measured tree height. While all lidar-based methods, including raster CHM comparison, tended to underestimate the field estimate of growth, Lmax provided the most robust overall direct estimate (0.32 m/yr, σ=0.37 m). A single factor analysis of variance demonstrated that there was no statistically significant difference between all plot-level field and Lmax mean growth rate estimates (P=0.38) and, further, that there was no difference in Lmax growth rate estimates across the examined time intervals (P=0.59). A power function relationship between time interval and the standard deviation of error in growth estimate demonstrated that over a one-year period, the growth uncertainty was in the range of 0.3 m (∼100% of total growth) reducing to less than 0.1 m (∼6% of total growth) after 5 years. Assuming a 10% uncertainty is acceptable for operational or research-based conifer plantation growth estimates, this can be achieved at a three-year time interval.}

  abstract = {This paper addresses the modelling of uncertainty in an integrated geographic information system (GIS), specifically focused on the fusion of activities between GIS and remote sensing. As data is abstracted from its ‘raw’ form to the higher representations used by GIS, it passes through a number of different conceptual data models via a series of transformations. Each model and each transformation process contributes to the overall uncertainty present within the data. The issues that this paper addresses are threefold. Firstly, a description of various models of geographic space is given in terms of the inherent uncertainty characteristics that apply; this is then worked into a simple formalism. Secondly, the various transformation processes that are used to form geographic classes or objects from image data are described, and their effects on the uncertainty properties of data are stated. Thirdly, using the formalism to describe the transformation processes, a framework for the propagation of uncertainty through an integrated GIS is derived. By way of a summary, a table describing sources of accumulated uncertainty across four underlying models of geographic space is derived.}

    ABSTRACT = {Quantitative uncertainty analysis is generally taken as an indispensable step in the calibration of a remote sensor. A full uncertainty propagation chain has not been established to set up the metrological traceability for surface reflectance inversed from remotely sensed images. As a step toward this goal, we proposed an uncertainty analysis method for the two typical semi-empirical topographic correction models, i.e., C and Minnaert, according to the ‘Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM)’. We studied the data link and analyzed the uncertainty propagation chain from the digital elevation model (DEM) and at-sensor radiance data to the topographic corrected radiance. We obtained spectral uncertainty characteristics of the topographic corrected radiance as well as its uncertainty components associated with all of the input quantities by using a set of Earth Observation-1 (EO-1) Hyperion data acquired over a rugged soil surface partly covered with snow. Firstly, the relative uncertainty of cover types with lower radiance values was larger for both C and Minnaert corrections. Secondly, the trend of at-sensor radiance contributed to a spectral feature, where the uncertainty of the topographic corrected radiance was poor in bands below 1400 nm. Thirdly, the uncertainty components associated with at-sensor radiance, slope, and aspect dominated the total combined uncertainty of corrected radiance. It was meaningful to reduce the uncertainties of at-sensor radiance, slope, and aspect for reducing the uncertainty of corrected radiance and improving the data quality. We also gave some suggestions to reduce the uncertainty of slope and aspect data.},
